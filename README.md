# AUTOMATED CRIME REPORT VISUALISATION AND SECURE PATH PREDICTION

The partial code for my final project, *AUTOMATED CRIME REPORT VISUALISATION AND SECURE PATH PREDICTION*, which will be hosted with digital ocean soon.

## Installation and Set Up
Prerequisites:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.6.7/)
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Clone the repo from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/davis67/finalyrproject.git
```

Create a virtual environment for the project and activate it:

```
linux/mac users ;- python3 -m venv venv
windows users ;- virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Database configuration
You will need to create a MySQL user your terminal, as well as a MySQL database. Then, grant all privileges on your database to your user, like so:

```
$ mysql -u root

mysql> CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password_here';

mysql> CREATE DATABASE crimes_final_year_project;

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON crimes_final_year_project . * TO 'root'@'localhost';
```

Note that you can use sqlite, postgres or any other.Dont be limited to mysql. After creating the database, run migrations as follows:

* `flask db init`
* `flask db migrate`
* `flask db upgrade`

## instance/config.py file
Create a directory, `instance`, and in it create a `config.py` file. This file should contain configuration variables that should not be publicly shared, such as passwords and secret keys. The app requires you to have the following configuration
variables:
* SECRET_KEY
* SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI (`'mysql://user:password@localhost/database_name'`)

## Launching the Program
Set the FLASK_APP and FLASK_CONFIG variables as follows:

* `export FLASK_APP=run.py`
* `export FLASK_CONFIG=development`

You can now run the app with the following command: `flask run`

## Built With...
